# Project Name: 
My First Excel Dashboard


----
# Objective: 
The aim of this project is to create a dynamic dashboard for visualising/comparing the extent of the covid19 pandemic in Africa and Europe.


----
# Data Sourcing: 
Global Covid19 data is scraped real-time from the john hopkins hospital repository on covid19 (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data) and is loaded into an Excel Workbook. Also, information on the various countries (like the continents and regions they belong to) was sourced from www.statistica.com


----
# Data Transformation: 
Using Power Query, I transformed the scraped data (confirmed cases, Deaths and recoveries) into a consolidated table containing only the fields of interest and properly formated each data column. Also, The "Index" and "Match" functions were used to introduce a continent column to the table for further analysis.


----
# Findings and Recomendation:
After carrying out detailed analysis of the data, I found that the number of cases and deaths confirmed in Europe far surpassed those reported in Africa. Unfortunately, I discovered the the mortality rate for Covid19 patients in Africa was almost twice as high that of Europe. Lastly, while Africa has seen a significant decrease in new cases since the start of the year, Europe is experiencing an upsurge likely due to the prevalence of the more contagious Omicron variant.

I therefore recommend that there should be an increase in efforts to enlighten the populace on the high rate of covid spread eventhough most lockdowns have been lifted.
